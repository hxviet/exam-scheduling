# Exam scheduling
This repository includes implementation of several algorithms for scheduling exams at schools according to time and room capacity constraints.

## Problem description

There are $N$ exams, denoted by $1$, $2$, ..., $N$, which need to be scheduled. Each exam $i$ is to be sat by $d(i)$ students.

There are $M$ exam rooms that can be used, denoted by $1$, $2$, ..., $M$. Each room $j$ can accomodate at most $c(j)$ students at a time.

Each exam must be administered in one exam period (or time slot), of which there are four on every exam day. In many cases, two exams cannot be held in the same exam period because some students want to sit both of them.

Given these constraints, one needs to work out an exam plan allocating each exam to an exam period and exam room minimizing the number of exam days needed.
